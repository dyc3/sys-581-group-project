= High Throughput Message Queue (HTMQ)

The High Throughput Message Queue (HTMQ) is the backbone of interplanetary communications. The immediate goal is to enable reliable communication between Earth and Mars, but eventually to be able to scale up to connect future colonies in the solar system. It is a high data transfer, high capacity, high reliability message queue that is used to send messages between network nodes within the solar system. The HTMQ is a store-and-forward message queue that is designed to handle the high latency and high error rates of interplanetary communications. It is a distributed system that is implemented as a network of message queues that are connected by high-speed optical laser links. The HTMQ is designed to be fault-tolerant and scalable to meet future needs.

== Architecture

The HTMQ is a distributed system that is implemented as a network of priority message queues. Each message queue is a node in the network. The system keeps track of the physical location of each node so that it can route messages to the correct next hop. The system is designed to be fault-tolerant so that it can continue to operate even if some nodes are temporarily unavailable or lost. The system is analogous to the Internet, but with a focus on interplanetary communications.

=== Alternatives Considered

A few alternative systems have been considered for long range communication.

== Handshaking and Connection Establishment

Due to the highly directional nature of laser communications, establishing a laser link requires alignment of the transmitter and receiver. This is done as a part of the handshaking process.

As shown in @Figure::htmq-handshake, first, the transmitter sends a beacon signal addressed to the receiver over traditional RF communications. Using reaction wheels, the spacecraft can adjust its orientation to align the laser with the receiver. Once the laser link is established, the transmitter and receiver perform a PQXDH key exchange to establish a secure connection. @kret2023pqxdh Once complete, the connection is considered fully established and message transfer can begin.

=== Encryption

The HTMQ uses the PQXDH key exchange algorithm to establish a secure connection between nodes. PQXDH is a post-quantum key exchange algorithm that is designed to be secure against quantum computers. @kret2023pqxdh @cryspenPQXDH

Notably, the PQXDH key exchange algorithm has three parties: Alice (the sender), Bob (the receiver), and the server, the purpose of which is to support asynchronisity in the time Alice sends the message and Bob receives it. @kret2023pqxdh However, for the purpose of internode communication in the HTMQ, the server is not used. Instead, the sender and receiver directly exchange keys. Bob takes the role of both the receiver and the server.

== Data Transfer

High speed data transfer is one of the key features of the HTMQ. This high data transfer rate allows the HTMQ to handle the large amounts of data that are generated by interplanetary missions. The HTMQ will be able to handle the data transfer requirements of future missions, including but not limited to manned missions to Mars. Note that because of the laws of physics, this does not mean that latency is low. Rather, transfer speed merely refers to the amount of data that can be transferred in a given time frame.

Using optical laser links, the HTMQ can transfer data at speeds of up to 200 Gbps in the vacuum of space. @NASAfastestlaserlink Laser links are used because they are faster than radio links and have a significantly higher bandwidth, and the directed nature of lasers makes intercepting messages difficult. @NASAlasercomms

Shown in @Figure::htmq-node-relay, once a connection is established, messages are relayed from node to node until they reach their destination. Each node in the network is responsible for routing messages to the correct next hop. Nodes can only dispose of a message once it receives an acknowledgment from the *destination* node. This ensures that messages are not lost in transit. Messages are broken down into packets, which are then sent over the laser link. The packets are reassembled at the destination node, and retransmission is attempted if any packets are lost.

=== Messages

Messages in the HTMQ are stored in a priority queue. Each message has a priority level that determines the order in which it is processed. Messages with higher priority levels are processed before messages with lower priority levels. Messages are stored in the queue until they are delivered to their destination. The system is designed to handle messages of any size, from small telemetry packets to large image files.

Once a message is delivered to its destination, the destination node sends an acknowledgment back to the source node. This acknowledgment is used to confirm that the message was successfully delivered. If the acknowledgment is not received within a certain time frame, nodes in the network will attempt to resend the message along a different route.
