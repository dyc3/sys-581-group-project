= System Robustness Throughout Lifecycle

== Reliability

Ensuring the reliability of the C3 communication system is critical for the success of the mission and the well-being of the colonists and crew. The system must be designed to withstand the harsh environmental conditions on Mars, including extreme temperatures, high levels of radiation, and potential wear and tear over time.

Each subsystem will be designed with the goal of high reliability in mind. This includes redundancy in critical components, regular maintenance and testing procedures, and robust error detection and correction mechanisms. The C3 communication system will be rigorously tested in simulated conditions to ensure its reliability under challenging circumstances.

The HTMQ architecture is designed in such a way that most satellites will likely be underutilized. If one satellite fails, the others can take over its functions. This redundancy ensures that even in the loss of a satellite, the system can continue to operate effectively. 

The DSP will also employ an automatic repeat request (ARQ) error-control strategy to handle packet loss and ensure reliable communication between probes and Earth stations. This mechanism allows for the retransmission of lost packets, reducing the risk of data corruption or loss.
