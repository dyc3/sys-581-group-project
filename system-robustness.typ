= System Robustness Throughout Lifecycle

== Reliability

Ensuring the reliability of the C3 communication system is critical for the success of the mission and the well-being of the colonists and crew. The system must be designed to withstand the harsh environmental conditions on Mars, including extreme temperatures, high levels of radiation, and potential wear and tear over time.

Each subsystem will be designed with the goal of high reliability in mind. This includes redundancy in critical components, regular maintenance and testing procedures, and robust error detection and correction mechanisms. The C3 communication system will be rigorously tested in simulated conditions to ensure its reliability under challenging circumstances.

The HTMQ architecture is designed in such a way that most satellites will likely be underutilized. If one satellite fails, the others can take over its functions. This redundancy ensures that even in the loss of a satellite, the system can continue to operate effectively. 

The DSP will also employ an automatic repeat request (ARQ) error-control strategy to handle packet loss and ensure reliable communication between probes and Earth stations. This mechanism allows for the retransmission of lost packets, reducing the risk of data corruption or loss.

== Maintainability

Maintaining the C3 communication system is crucial for extending the sustainability of the mission and ensuring uninterrupted communication capabilities for the colony. The system is designed with maintainability in mind, making it easier for crew members to conduct maintenance and repairs as needed.

Due to the nature of the system architecture, making physical repairs to the hardware is a difficult task. In the process of deploying the Hubble space telescope, NASA discovered that the telescope's mirror was flawed. To fix this, they launched a space shuttle to the telescope and installed a Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) instrument package. @NASA_Hubble_Mirror_Flaw This is a costly and time-consuming process, and one that can not be applied to the C3 system. The satellites are distributed across large distances, and it is not feasible to send a crew to repair a satellite. The system will undergo rigorous testing and quality assurance procedures before deployment to minimize the risk of hardware failure.

If a software issue arises, the system can be updated remotely. The software architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for updates and patches to be applied without disrupting the overall system. This ensures that the system can adapt to changing requirements and technologies over time.

== Supportability 

To enhance the supportability of the C3 system, it will incorporate a monitoring framework equipped with diagnostic tools and sensors. These components are strategically integrated within the system's infrastructure to continuously assess the health and functionality of both the communication hardware and software of each subsystem. This includes real-time monitoring of signal integrity, bandwidth usage, and system latency, which are critical for maintaining optimal communication between Earth and Mars.

Data from these diagnostics are logged and can be analyzed by the mission control team on Earth and by astronauts on Mars, facilitating immediate identification of potential issues like signal degradation. The ability to detect these problems early ensures that preventive measures can be taken before a fatal error occurs.

Furthermore, the C3 system includes comprehensive training modules for all crew members, ensuring they are well-prepared to handle standard operations and troubleshoot issues as they arise. Detailed documentation covering system maintenance, routine checks, and common troubleshooting procedures is also made available digitally for ease of access. This documentation is regularly updated to reflect any modifications or upgrades to the system. Crew members and mission control will be equipped with the necessary tools and training to respond swiftly and effectively to failures, ensuring the C3 system remains robust and reliable throughout the duration of the Mars mission.
